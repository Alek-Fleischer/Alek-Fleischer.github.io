**Produced track 38 ("Strobequake")**

An album made in 2 hours about monochromaticity.

38\. **Strobequake:** "Black and White" is an interesting theme to work into music. I was reminded of how the music video for "Ponyboy" by SOPHIE is dominated by this huge flashing screen in the background, so I made a track inspired by that.

Honestly I think this track is an overly-derivative trainwreck, but I think that's OK. These 2-hour Abstractionauts projects are like game jams: if you make something good, great! If not, very little time was wasted and it's no big deal. Actually as I was typing this I heard the outro of the piece and that was pretty cool so there's that.
