Tracks made for a compilation back in 2010 that never really materialized. If you want to know how terrible I used to sound, now you can!

1. **Part 2a - Begin:** Seriously like half this track is taken up by two really long sample pitch slides.
2. **Part 2b - Glitchy:** 2010 me tries to make IDM. It doesn't really work out.
3. **Part 5 - Continue:** I like this more than the other two tracks. It feels more cohesive, which lets the anarchic sample experimentation feel fun instead of random and contextless. I still remember this track pretty well even after 8 years, so that must count for something.
