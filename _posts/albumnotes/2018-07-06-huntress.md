"Hey good people, i have the pleasure to present you the result of the hard work we put in the Metroid Album! Once again i’m thanking you guys for participating to those projects! I really hope you’ll enjoy this album, i can’t wait to know what you think about it ^^
Feel free to share this album anywhere you can as much as you can!

Huntress focuses exclusively on the classic Metroid titles, giving us the possibility to make a Metroid Prime album in the future.

We do not own any of those songs, they were composed by:
* Hirokazu Tanaka (Metroid)
* Ryoji Yoshitomi (Metroid II)
* Kenji Yamamoto (super Metroid)
* Minako Hamano (Super Metroid, Metroid Fusion)
* Akira Fujiwara (Metroid Fusion)

This album has 30 songs from the classic 2D Metroid games and is 1h35 long.
This is clearly our darkest album with a lot of great atmospheric tracks with a lot of electro and rock/metal songs to fit the oppressing feeling of the Metroid OST."
