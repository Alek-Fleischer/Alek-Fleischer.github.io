Soundtrack to my Ludum Dare 32 game, which can be found [here](https://alekfleischer.itch.io/quality-television).

1. **Sinister Governmental Body:** This track plays throughout most of the game. This melody was bouncing around in my head for awhile, and seemed to fit well. The second half of the track adds a few more instruments; in-game, it plays when the TV is active.
2. **Most Interesting Show:** Since "Sinister Governmental Body" plays for most of the game, it made sense for the ending tracks to be variations on it.
3. **Hypnotized:** The background noise creates the impression of a huge space, while the basic square wave emphasizes the player's smallness within it. The effect is actually pretty spooky and provides a nice contrast with the rest of the game.
