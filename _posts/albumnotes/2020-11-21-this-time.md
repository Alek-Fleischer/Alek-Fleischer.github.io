**Produced track 10 ("Counterpulse")**

", let's try something a little different"

10\. **Counterpulse:** This track is basically built around 4:3 polyrhythms. The seed of this idea was pairing Buoy Base Galaxy with Smooth, but I thought that combination sounded awkward on its own. But by making this slightly weird rhythm the whole concept of the track (by introducing lots more elements that do it), it feels much more intentional. I even through in a clip of Adam Neely talking about polyrhythms because I thought it'd be funny. The fact that Smooth melodically matches up with Buoy Base so well is kind of scary.
