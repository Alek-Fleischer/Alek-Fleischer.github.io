"The Two Hour Album Challenge (2HAC) is a community-driven challenge to collectively start and complete an album of music in two hours.

At the start of the challenge, a theme is chosen randomly. Each participant then independently (or collaboratively) writes a song with that theme in mind using a strict time limit of two hours.

This album is free to download, proceeds from album purchases will go to the Angel of Hope animal rescue: [www.aohrescue.org](https://www.aohrescue.org)
