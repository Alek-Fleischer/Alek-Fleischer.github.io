**Produced track 20 ("[timestretch/hell]")**

"The Two Hour Album Challenge (2HAC) is a community-driven challenge to collectively start and complete an album of music in two hours.

At the start of the challenge, a theme is chosen randomly. Each participant then independently (or collaboratively) writes a song with that theme in mind using a strict time limit of two hours.

This album is free to download, proceeds from album purchases will go to the Angel of Hope animal rescue: [www.aohrescue.org](https://www.aohrescue.org)

More information can be found here: [2hac.abstractionmusic.com](https://2hac.abstractionmusic.com)"

This is the second 2HAC and the first I've participated in. The theme was "stretch and split", as you might have guessed.

20\. **[timestretch/hell]:** Stylistically this reminds me a bit of my early work. I was pretty busy when this was going on so I actually only spent 1 hour on this track! It still came out pretty neat though. The album track order is simply the same as submission order, so this crazy track ended up being sandwiched between two ambient pieces, which I like a lot: it basically makes it the Surprise Symphony of the album. ARE YOU PAYING ATTENTION?
