This music was originally intended to be a video game soundtrack, but the game never ended up getting made. I didn't want to let the tracks I composed for it go to waste, so here they are as a standalone album. Most of these are boss themes, with the exception of the first track.

(When judging this album, please keep in mind that it's goddamn ancient)
