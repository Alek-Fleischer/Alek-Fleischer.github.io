**Produced track 33 ("Scorch n' Torch")**

"Hey friends, here is our very last album of 2018:
Treetop Tunes, a tribute to Donkey Kong Country music!
2018 has been an amazing year for us, we released some of our most ambitious projects ever! So thanks so much to everyone who participated in any way to the making of those albums. And thanks so much to everyone who took a bit of time to listen to our arrangements and even leave some kind words, those mean a lot to us =)
I wish to all of you, a really nice 2019!

This album features 35 songs from the original DKC Trilogy, but also the GBA version of DKC 3, DKC Returns and DKC Tropical Freeze!
We gathered 44 musicians to make more than 2h of music!

We do not own any of the music, they were mostly composed by David Wise & Eveline Fischer."

I, Aleksander Fleischer, support trans rights.

33\. **Scorch n' Torch:** What if Donkey Kong: Tropical Freeze sounded like Danger? It'd sound better than this probably but I still had a lot of fun making it.
