**Produced track 26 ("The Loudest Patch of Green")**

"Let's celebrate and hit the streets!"

26\. **The Loudest Patch of Green:** This track was very hard to mix because "The Loudest Patch of Grass" is an incredibly loud and in your face sample, so I needed everything else to match its intensity. Otherwise this is a pretty straightforward mashup.
