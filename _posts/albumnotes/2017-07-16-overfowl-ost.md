A tiny EP that acts as the soundtrack to a jam game by felres.

1. **Prepare to Overfowl:** A pretty straightforward filtered version of the main theme. Plays during the tutorial and the main menu.
2. **OVERFOWL:** The main event. felres's reference for the sound he was looking for was [the soundtrack to Keyboard Drumset Fucking Werewolf](https://fwamusic.bandcamp.com/track/ii-keep-my-adresse-to-yourself-cause-we-need-secrets). In hindsight, OVERFOWL doesn't really sound much like that at all (if anything, it's a poor knockoff), but I think I was able to capture some of the absurd energy they were looking for. And hey, I just got to type the phrase "Keyboard Drumset Fucking Werewolf" in the context of serious liner notes! So I guess it was worth it in the end.
