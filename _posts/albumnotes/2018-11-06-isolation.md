**Produced track 25 ("Alarms Echo in my Dreams")**

An album made in 2 hours about loneliness.

25\. **Alarms Echo in my Dreams:** A dark ambient piece. Instead of just adding more layers, I tried to slowly modulate and distort a small number of layers over the course of the track. There's also a vague depressing narrative about someone stuck in a spaceship.
