A single cover of "Compass" from Disasterpeace's amazing Fez soundtrack. There are a lot of new parts that sort of improvise on the harmonic ideas of the original. I tried to make it sound like Minecraft, but the funny thing is that C418 did his own cover of the same song and it sounds nothing like mine.
