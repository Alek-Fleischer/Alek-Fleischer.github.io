4\. **Personal Palaver:** I feel good about how this turned out. Making something catchy was important because the player's gonna hear this restart many times.

5\. **Powerful Prism:** This was made quickly near the end of development. It's a little boring, but makes a cool vibe and hypes up the importance of what's going on.

9\. **Piercing Prize:** This song is really goofy for no reason??? idk I made this at 2am and I was delirious
