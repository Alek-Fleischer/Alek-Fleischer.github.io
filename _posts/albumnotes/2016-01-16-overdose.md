Music for a trashy creepypasta. (Don't laugh, it's very serious) <http://distractionware.com/forum/index.php?topic=2382>

1. **Pipe Nightmare:** This track is mostly dominated by a sample of "Pipe Dream" by SoulEye. I had fun manipulating it in spooky ways; my favorite part is the messed up triangle wave melody near the end.
2. **Stop Running:** This sound that plays when the level fake-crashes was inspired by the sound Metroid Prime on the Gamecube would make if it ran out of memory trying to load too fast.
