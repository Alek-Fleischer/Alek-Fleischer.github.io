A couple tracks I made for ["Betaworld"](http://distractionware.com/forum/index.php?topic=3707.0), a VVVVVV level by Betaworld Team.

1. **Dark Dimension:** Music for exploration. A simple track to set the mood for a dark, mysterious dimension. But there's some lightheartedness to it too.
2. **I Can Feel Again:** Quiet, reflective track for the ending. Triangle waves are good for this type of thing. Also, I used chiptune sounds like pulse waves more prominently than I usually do in my recent stuff.
