**Featured on track 4 ("Interlude: Not Every Soldier Was Booing")**

"Neoliberalism Resigned!"

4\. **Interlude: Not Every Soldier Was Booing: (feature)** Frida, Eva, and I collabed on this track over Discord. It was fun bouncing ideas off each other for this silly track, and the result ended up pretty unique.
