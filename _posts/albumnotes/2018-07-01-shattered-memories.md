**Guest on disc 2 track 11 ("Omen")**

"'Shattered Memories' [is] a tribute album to XenoGears music!
We made this tribute album to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the game, release in February 1998. We gathered more than 60 musicians and re-arranged 36 tracks from the OST!

The soundtrack was composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, the famous composer of Chrono Trigger & Chrono Cross. If XenoGears still has some of his musical signature, the global mood is more serious and dark than CT&CC, due to the main themes of game, being really mature.
The Length of this album is almost 2 hours and 20 minutes, we covered most of the tracks from the OST (36) and tried to give a new 'life' to those VGM gems!
Once again we tried to bring as much as variety as possible, with: prog rock, metal, classical, jazz, folk, Celtic rock, fusion, EDM and more!"
