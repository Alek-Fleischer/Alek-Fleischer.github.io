**Produced track 8 ("ALLISON FLEISCHER TYPE BEAT")**

"The main album of LULUCO IN DA TEAPOT. Bonus tracks are on Side-B."

8\. **ALLISON FLEISCHER TYPE BEAT:** A silly hodgepodge of various injokes from previous mashups, plus JPEGMAFIA TYPE BEAT. The "this is not (music)" at the end is the musical equivalent of "the person below gay"
