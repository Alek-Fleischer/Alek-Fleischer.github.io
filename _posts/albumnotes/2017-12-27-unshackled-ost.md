This is the soundtrack to a VVVVVV mod I made:
[distractionware.com/forum/index.php?topic=3388.msg34661](http://distractionware.com/forum/index.php?topic=3388.msg34661)

The mod is a new campaign. The goal was to have a more character-driven narrative than the original game. The soundtrack is darker and harsher than the original VVVVVV soundtrack to match, though there are still a few references.

tracks 3 and 9: sampled and melodically referenced content from "PPPPPP" by Magnus PÃ¥lsson
